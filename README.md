# TypeScript Fundamentals - Vehicle Interface & Car Class

## 📚 Overview

This project demonstrates basic TypeScript fundamentals by defining an interface and implementing it in a class. The goal is to show how interfaces and classes work together in TypeScript.

---

## 🚗 What It Does

- Defines a `Vehicle` interface with:
  - `make`: string
  - `model`: string
  - `year`: number
  - `start()`: method that logs "Engine started"

- Implements a `Car` class that:
  - Implements the `Vehicle` interface
  - Initializes the vehicle’s details through a constructor
  - Overrides the `start()` method to log: `"Car engine started"`

- Creates an instance of the `Car` class and calls its `start()` method.

## 📁 Files

- `car.ts` – TypeScript source file with the interface and class implementation.
- `car.js` – JavaScript file compiled from `car.ts`.
